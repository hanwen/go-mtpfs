INTRODUCTION

Go-mtpfs is a simple FUSE filesystem that I wrote because mtpfs was
very unstable for me. 

It will expose all storage areas of a device in the mount, and only
reads file metadata as needed, making it mount more quickly.

It has been tested on Galaxy Nexus (ICS) and Motorola Xoom (HC), with
libmtp 1.1.3.


COMPILATION

* Install the Go compiler suite; e.g. on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install golang-go

* Install libmtp header files

    sudo apt-get install libmtp-dev

* Then run

    mkdir /tmp/go 
    export GOPATH=/tmp/go
    go get github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs

  /tmp/go/bin/go-mtpfs will then contain the program binary.

* A 32 and 64-bit linux x86 binaries are at

USAGE

  mkdir xoom
  go-mtpfs xoom &
  cp -a ~/Music/Some-Album xoom/Music/
  fusermount -u xoom

After a file is closed (eg. if "cp" completes), it is safe to unplug
the device; the filesystem then will continue to function, but
generates I/O errors when it reads from or writes to the device.
