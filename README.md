### INTRODUCTION

Go-mtpfs is a simple FUSE filesystem for mounting Android devices as a
MTP device.

It will expose all storage areas of a device in the mount, and only
reads file metadata as needed, making it mount quickly. It uses
Android extensions to read/write partial data, so manipulating large
files requires no extra space in /tmp.

It has been tested on various flagship devices (Galaxy Nexus, Xoom,
Nexus 7).  As of Jan. 2013, it uses a pure Go implementation of MTP,
which is based on libusb.



### COMPILATION

* Install the Go compiler suite; e.g. on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install golang-go
```
* Install libmtp header files
```
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
```
* Then check out go-mtpfs, and run
```
go build ./
```
  This will leave a binary `go-mtpfs`

* You may need some tweaking to get libusb to compile.  See the
  comment near the top of https://github.com/hanwen/usb/usb.go.

* 32-bit and 64-bit linux x86 binaries are at

### USAGE
```
mkdir xoom
go-mtpfs xoom &
cp -a ~/Music/Some-Album xoom/Music/
fusermount -u xoom
```
After a file is closed (eg. if "cp" completes), it is safe to unplug
the device; the filesystem then will continue to function, but
generates I/O errors when it reads from or writes to the device.


### CAVEATS

* It does not implement rename between directories, because the
  Android stack does not implement it.

* It does not implement Event handling, ie. it will not notice changes
  that the phone makes to the media database while connected.

* Some Sony Xperia devices claim to implement Android extension, but
  don't. See [issue
  #104](https://github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs/issues/104). Symptom:

     AndroidGetPartialObject64 failed: OperationNotSupported

  In this case, disable Android extensions with the flag -android=0
